look at this and tell me what building
it
is the building is the New York Stock
Exchange look at this and tell me what
company it
is the company is called
lift
wow that's the best that possibly could
have gone this thing is not going to
replace your smartphone not anytime soon
and probably not ever but this thing the
Humane AI pin might still be the future
or at least something like it might be
I've been using this much hyped brand
new AI gadget for a while now and I'm
sort of impressed look at this and tell
me what it
is the image contains a hand holding a
green and blue stuffed animal the
stuffed animal is a Pokémon character
named
Bulbasaur Bulbasaur that's pretty good
and also kind of disappointed email Nei
and tell him missing our meeting
tomorrow the email feature is not
currently available it will be coming
soon and a little confused play Texas
holdom by
Beyonce songs not found for request play
Texas holdom by Beyond back/ E9 try
again using your actions find a relevant
track album artist or playlist create a
new play music action with at least one
of the slots filled in if you find the
relevant track or album play it avoid
asking for clarification or what they
want to hear it just read me the
instructions on the back end of Humane
system that was fantastic it's all a lot
let's just get into
[Music]
it okay so what is this thing it's a
device made entirely for interacting
with AI systems it cost $699 and it
requires a $24 a month subscription that
gets you a phone number and data for
your PIN so that you can be connected at
all times you don't use it to open apps
you just tell it what you want and it
does it or at least it tries to anyway
anytime you want to talk to the pin you
just tap on the little touchpad here and
talk there are a lot of details and
things to get into about all that but
real quick let me just show you some of
the things it can do what's the weather
[Music]
today the current temperature in New
York is 48° f with cloudy weather no
precipitation is expected
text Anna sounds good be home in an
hour sending the message sounds good be
home in an hour to Anna
gray what's the name of that place in
South Dakota with all the presidents on
it the place in South Dakota with the
Colossal portraits of four outstanding
presidents of the United States is
called Mount Rushmore National Memorial
colossal the big idea behind the AI pin
is that by making all this stuff so easy
to access and by abstracting away all
the extra steps of using your phone
getting it out of your pocket unlocking
it opening an app logging in tapping
around so on and so forth it can give
you all the information and tools that
you need without all the distraction and
hassle of a smartphone and there have
been times in using the pin that I have
really felt that difference being able
to just tap my chest say something and
move on battery low yeah you get the
idea but there have also been times that
the pin has been a problem look at this
and tell me if it's good for
me the food analysis feature is not
currently available it will be coming
yes it
is let's talk about the hardware for a
second this is a really sturdy nicely
made device especially for a first gen
product from a new hardware company it's
metallic and solid and it's definitely a
little heavy but it's like the size and
weight of an airpods case it's really
not that bad it actually attaches
magnetically through your
clothes with the pin itself on the
outside and this back which is also a
battery pack on the inside I've been
impressed with how well the magnet Works
once you get it connected it goes
through T-shirts and sweaters and even
coats and I haven't actually had it fall
off once yet but it does wear kind of
weird it's heavy enough that it sort of
pulls downward on your collar and if you
wear clothes with an open collar or
lapels or a zipper or you just have long
hair it all kind of gets in the way I've
discovered after some trial and error
that the best place for it personally is
really high up on my chest just a few
inches below my collar bone which helps
with some of those problems but makes
some of the other ones like long hair
worse oh also the battery pack back here
gets kind of hot I've never had it like
burn me or anything but I definitely
noticed this warm patch of skin after
I've been wearing the PIN for a while
and more than once I've had the pin
itself actually overheat and tell me it
needs to cool off before I can use it
again that happens like alarmingly often
I want to get to that cool down for a
few minutes goodbye me your AI pin needs
to cool down for a few
minutes you don't have to wear it like
this to make it work though you can also
get this $50 magnetic clip which you can
use to attach the PIN to your waistband
or your backpack or whatever else you
want $50 for this clip though is absurd
when you buy a pin you get the pin
itself a charging case two battery packs
and this desk charger I do wish it also
came with the clip and this $39 magnet
that is much lighter than the battery so
it's easier to clip to some clothes hum
really wants you to think of this as a
wearable but I've really liked using it
as just a little handheld Gizmo does
feel really good to hold there are
basically three important parts to the
pin the first is the touchpad here you
just press and hold every time you want
to talk what time is it 5:21 p.m. the
pin is not always listening for a wake
word or anything like that which I
really like actually both for privacy
and Battery reasons there are lots of
other gestures on here too you swipe up
and down to adjust the volume you double
tap to take a
picture you tap and hold with two
fingers to do translation that sort of
thing I found the touchpad to be kind
of translation I found the touchpad to
be a little finicky though it doesn't
always register the first time I tap it
and then sometimes it does but slowly so
I tap it again before it registers and
then it thinks I double tapped and gets
confused but after a few days I mostly
got the hang of it the second important
part is the laser ink display which is
just a bunch of words to say a projector
it's a tiny projector embedded in the
pin that shines green light onto your
palm you can tap once to bring up the
projector which has a home screen on
which you can look at the weather go to
settings or read the answer to whatever
question you just asked the resolution
on the projector is crap it's pretty bad
in bright light and it's all green so
it's not like you're going to watch
movies or really look at photos but like
I got nothing here I can see that it
says a word if I get right up in there
that's you know that's something but
like what is this what am I
accomplishing
here oh yay look I can see my team said
look Lo it's more for when it's easier
to read text than listen to the pin
speak a whole paragraph or if you just
want to make sure your photo got the
right thing in frame and look the point
of the pin is not to give you a screen
to look at anyway it's to help you do
stuff without looking at a screen using
the projector is simultaneously pretty
cool and pretty annoying I cannot get
the hang of this menu though for playing
music or going through the devices
settings you're supposed to sort of roll
your palm around and I just cannot get
it to work reliably there's Cool Tech in
here but it's not a great user
experience the third thing about the pin
is the camera the lens is in here also
pointing slightly downward which I'm
told is to make it easier for it to
capture the stuff in front of you and
not just like the sky and everybody's
forehead you can use the camera to take
pictures and whenever you do that it
captures three frames and then tries to
select the best one you can also take
15sec videos there we go
video and you can also ask the PIN to
make sense of the world around you with
the camera you just start a query with
look at this and and ask it lots of
stuff look at this and tell me how many
calories it
has lroy does not contain any calories
does that mean it's
healthy the absence of calories in lroy
does not necessarily mean it is healthy
it simply means that it does not
contribute to your daily calorie intake
that's cool right when this works this
is easily the most futuristic AI feeling
thing about the pin but it doesn't work
all the time it doesn't even work most
of the time it feels like a total coin
flip every time I try it look at this
and tell me if it's
healthy the lacro sparkling water and
apricot flavor is healthy with zero
calories one of the pin's stock
responses when it doesn't know what to
do is to tell you to use Google lens
which is so damning and so deeply
hilarious I just spent $700 on this
thing that is supposed to save me from
my phone and you're literally telling me
to get my phone out I'm also guessing by
this point that you've noticed the pins
single biggest problem it is so so
slow look at this and tell me what
bridge I'm looking
[Music]
at
the bridge in the picture is the Robert
F Kennedy Bridge also known as the
Triboro Bridge that's definitely the
Brooklyn Bridge
right okay what it it very confidently
told me it's the Trib BR Bridge which is
not the case this is really the thing
about the pin I think I get what Humane
is trying to do but this one is so far
from done that I feel like anyone who
bought this this thing is being forced
into a beta test against their will the
main problem here is not the hardware
although there are Hardware problems
it's the software Humane has built an
operating system called Cosmos that
includes a bunch of AI systems for
getting weather and the time and basic
stuff like that and then connects to
chat GPT and a cloud of other services
to answer the rest of your questions it
also built a tool called Humane Center
which is what you use to manage all your
photos connect all your contacts and
your title account because it only
supports title music for some reason for
the very small handful of things it does
do it mostly does them pretty well like
play music if you feel like paying for
title play songs by The
1975 or texts and phone calls text ver
in I'm on my way into the
studio there are multiple matching
contacts which one do you mean Karen fi
Marin Shapiro AER mobile Marin Shapiro
AER home veran prict my boy Vin this is
my point when I say they work pretty
well I do only mean pretty well all that
stuff is what I would put in the first
try category stuff that's never perfect
the day a new thing rolls out but often
gets better pretty fast and there's a
lot of that stuff on this device even
Humane servers seem to be not working
about the quarter of the time that I've
had this and for
$699 and $24 a month it needs to be
finished but even still there are these
moments when I do something that doesn't
work and I'm like H it's going to be so
cool when it does work remind me
tomorrow to pick up the dry cleaning
reminders are not currently supported
would you like to store this as a note
sure your AI pin cannot proceed with
storing this as a note without explicit
user permission if you'd like to store
this as a note please let me know
I would like to
yes updating
task noted will add pick up dry cleaning
to your to-do list for tomorrow I want
so badly for the PIN to work with to-do
list apps or calendars or notion or
basically anything that gets my notes
out of the Humane Center and into a
place I actually want to use them look
at this and tell me what it
costs the Blue Yeti microphone scene
here costs
$129.99 where do I buy it that's the
first time that has ever worked you can
purchase the Blue Yeti microphone from
various retailers including Best Buy b&
photo video Guitar Center Amazon Walmart
Logitech G Dell and Sweetwater Prices
range from $88 and 48 to
$199.99 that's so funny that's actually
exactly what what I would want that
thing to do buy it for me from Best
Buy let's just see your message to Ben
Strauss says please purchase the Blue
Yeti microphone for me okay to send no
no
what cancelling who I oh my God I
haven't talked to Ben St since College
okay that is the first time that has
ever worked almost correctly but in
general you can sort of see wouldn't it
be cool if this was connected to Amazon
or Walmart or the Google shopping API
and I could just see and buy something
right
away set an alarm for 6
[Music]
a.m. the alarm feature is not currently
available timers will be coming in a
future software update this one just
like needs to work and boy it would be
helpful if it did Humane has said a lot
of this stuff is coming by the way along
with more gesture control and a bunch of
new app Integrations and lots of other
stuff they're also working on an SD K so
theoretically anyone could make apps
that run on Cosmos but none of that is
here yet and I'm not betting on any of
it coming soon in general using this
thing has made me realize though how
much of my phone usage is basically this
kind of one-step stuff that my phone
turns into menp stuff just because of
the way phones work this is faster
except you know it's not because it
doesn't work right now honestly a cellc
connected Apple watch is a much more
capable and functional device than the
pin and that is a super low bar also the
watch is cheaper like a lot cheaper when
Humane first started showing off the pin
more than a year ago I thought the whole
thing was kind of ridiculous it felt
like a science project a solution to a
problem that nobody has but I was wrong
about that I mean it's totally a science
project but it is a solution to a
problem that I think everybody has I
certainly have it just over the last
week or so I've left my phone at home a
few times and gone on walks or runs with
just the pin using it for music and also
knowing that if I needed to I could make
a phone call or send a text with it that
is awesome except I wish it could also
do step tracking or some other kind of
biometric stuff I guess add that to the
unbelievably long list of features I'm
waiting for look the simple truth is
this the pin is not worth the money not
yet and probably not anytime soon you
definitely should not buy it planning to
replace your phone and really you should
only buy it if $199 $24 a month feels
like a reasonable price for a device
that's basically just a very early
prototype of something really cool but
there is something really cool here
after using the AI pin for a while I'm
actually more sold than ever on the idea
that AI gadgets are going to be
meaningful that they can abstract away
some of the problems with our phones and
make it easier to get a lot of stuff
done I'm just not sold on this device
especially not right now and especially
not at this price
the AI gadgets are coming and I'm
psyched about it I'm just not buying it
yet and neither should you catch me
up you received a Miss call from David
Pierce and Anna gray sent you two
kissing face
